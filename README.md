# Project Brief

- For the project I need to create a highly visual blog website (CRUD application) that is able to display atleast 3 blog posts  using :

=============

- Node.js
- Json
- jQuery
- JavaScript

=============

# Cloning this Repository

- When cloning this repository, you need to run the following commands in your CMD to create a localhost :

=============

- Open repository in editor of choice
- Open a new terminal and run "nodemon start"  (Open browser and type in url: localhost:3000 , this is to open the web application)
- Then open a new terminal and run "json-server --watch db.json -p 8000"  (Open browser and type in url: localhost:8000/posts, you listen on a different port so that your db.json doesnt clash)

=============

- If you dont have nodemon installed you need to first run the install command " npm install -g nodemon " before you can run "nodemon start"
